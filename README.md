# kirby-uniform

A versatile and powerful [Kirby 2](http://getkirby.com) plugin to handle web form actions.

See the [Kirby with Uniform](http://blog.the-inspired-ones.de/kirby-with-uniform) blog post for a complete tutorial on using Uniform.

Questions? See the [answers](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Answers) in the wiki, [post an issue](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/issues) if you think it is a bug or create a topic in [the forum](https://forum.getkirby.com/) (be sure to use the `uniform` tag).

Builtin actions:

- [email](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-contact-form/wiki/Action:-Email): Send the form data by email.
- [email-select](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Action:-Email-select): Choose from multiple recipients to send the form data by email.
- [log](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-contact-form/wiki/Action:-Log): Log the form data to a file.
- [login](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Action:-Login): Log in to the Kirby frontend.
- [webhook](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Action:-Webhook): Send the form data as a HTTP request to a webhook.
- [pages](https://github.com/tobystokes/kirby-uniform/wiki/Action:-pages): Send the form data as a HTTP request to a webhook.

## Installation

1. Copy or link the `uniform` directory to `site/plugins/` **or** use the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli) `kirby plugin:install mzur/kirby-uniform`.

2. Add the content of `uniform.css` to your CSS.

If you have a single language site you can choose the language Uniform should use in `site/config/config.php` (default is `en`):

```php
c::set('uniform.language', 'de');
```

For a **quick-start** jump directly to the [basic example](#basic).

## Usage

You first have to initialize the form in your form page controller like this:

```php
$form = uniform('contact-form',[
	'required' => [
		'_from' => 'email'
	],
	'actions' => [
		[
			'_action' => 'email',
			'to'      => (string) $page->email(),
			'sender'  => 'info@my-domain.tld',
			'subject' => $site->title()->html() . ' - message from the contact form'
		]
	]
]);
```

The **first** argument is a unique ID of the form on your entire website.

The **second** argument is the array of [options](#options). In this case the `_from` form field is required and validated as an email address. If the form data is correct, the `email` [action](#actions-1) is performed, sending the data to an email address specified in `$page->email()`.

You then create a form element with the own url of the page as `action` target like this:

```php
<form action="<?php echo $page->url()?>" method="post"></form>
```

The plugin then by default requires the presence of a `website` field acting as a honey pot and a `_submit` button. Note the `_` at the beginning of the field `name` attribute, marking it as special field that shouldn't be altered.

Here is an example with an additional `_from` field required by the `email` action:

```php
<label for="email" class="required">Email</label>
<input<?php e($form->hasError('_from'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="email" name="_from" id="email" value="<?php $form->echoValue('_from') ?>" required/>

<label class="uniform__potty" for="website">Please leave this field blank</label>
<input type="text" name="website" id="website" class="uniform__potty" />

<button type="submit" name="_submit" value="<?php echo $form->token() ?>"<?php e($form->successful(), " disabled")?>>Submit</button>
```

There are some important things happening here.

First, the `echoValue()` function is used to set the `value` of the email field. If the submission of the form has failed, this restores already set fields. So in this case you don't have to enter the email address again when the page is reloaded after submitting the form. Also, the `hasError()` function is used to mark the email field with a special class if the server-side validation failed. For more on the available functions, see [the functions section](#functions).

Second, the honey pot field uses the `uniform__potty` class. If you check the `uniform.css` you'll see that it makes the field disappear visually but not in the souce code of the page, the spam-bots are accessing.

Last, the submit button uses the `token()` function to set its value. The token is submitted along with all the other data of the form and ensures that the form can only be submitted directly from the website and not e.g. with an automated script that doesn't know the token. If the honeypot check fails, a new token is generated to make it harder to guess.

The presence of the last two elements with the exact `name` attributes and the token as a value of the submit button is critical for the plugin to work correctly! Actions may require their own fields like `_from`, too.

Now you can add as many additional form fields as you like but you shouldn't use the `_` prefix for your own field names.

## Options

These are the options of the options array. You have to specify at least one action. Everything else is, well, optional.

### guard

With this option you can configure which [Uniform guards](#guards) you wish to use. By default it is set to `honeypot` which will activate the [honeypot guard](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Guard:-Honeypot).

You can choose a different guard:

```php
'guard' => 'calc'
```

Combine guards:

```php
'guard' => ['honeypot', 'calc']
```

Or disable the spam protection:

```php
'guard' => ''
```

### required

Associative array of required form fields. The keys of the array are the `name` attributes of the required fields. The values of the entries are optional [validator function](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet#validators) names. Example:

```php
['_from' => 'email']
```

So the `_from` field is required and validated by the [`v::email`](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/validators/email) function. Note, that this works only with validator functions that validate single strings. If a field is required but should not be validated, leave the validator function name empty.

If a required field is missing, the form won't execute any actions.

### validate

Like [`required`](#required) but execution of the actions will *not* fail if one of these fields is missing. Only if one of these fields contains invalid data the actions will not be performed.

### actions

An array of [action](#actions-1) arrays. Each of these action arrays needs to contain at least an `_action` key with the name of the action that should be performed as value. It can contain arbitrary additional data for the action function. Example:

```php
[
	'_action' => 'email',
	'to'      => (string) $page->email(),
	'subject' => $site->title()->html() . ' - message from the contact form'
]
```

This way even the same actions can be performed multiple times when a form is submitted (like sending the form data to multiple email addresses).

## Guards

Uniform offers several mechanisms for spam protection. Similar to actions, guards can be extended and combined. To add custom guards, create a `site/plugins/uniform-guards/uniform-guards.php` file and implement all your custom guards there. Take a look at the [`calc` guard](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/blob/v2.2.1/uniform/guards/calc.php) to see how to implement one.

[See the wiki](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-contact-form/wiki#guards) for all the available guards.

## Actions

Once all required fields are present and validated, the actions are performed. These can be completely arbitrary functions that receive the form data and action options as arguments. An example is the builtin `email` action. You can create your own action, too, of course!

To add custom actions, create a `site/plugins/uniform-actions/uniform-actions.php` file and implement all your custom actions there. Take a look at the [`email` action](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/blob/v2.2.1/uniform/actions/email.php) to see how to implement one.

[See the wiki](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-contact-form/wiki#actions) for all the available actions.

## Functions

[See the wiki](https://github.com/mzur/kirby-uniform/wiki/Functions) for a complete list of functions of the Uniform object.

## Examples

Here are a few full examples that you could directly put into your controllers/templates. They make use of the [`e()`](http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/helpers/e) helper function of Kirby which is not a part of this plugin.

### basic

This form only asks for the name and email (both required) as well as a message. It restores values if the submission fails and displays the feedback message in a separate container. Note the `#form` anchor for jumping down to the feedback message when the form was submitted (especially important on mobile). This may be handled differently if the form is on your page root. If the form was submitted successfully, the submit button is disabled.

Controller:

```php
<?php

return function($site, $pages, $page) {
	$form = uniform('contact-form', [
		'required' => [
			'name'  => '',
			'_from' => 'email'
		],
		'actions' => [
			[
				'_action' => 'email',
				'to'      => 'me@example.com',
				'sender'  => 'info@my-domain.tld',
				'subject' => 'New message from the contact form'
			]
		]
	]);

	return compact('form');
};
```

Template:

```php
<form action="<?php echo $page->url()?>#form" method="post">

	<label for="name" class="required">Name</label>
	<input<?php e($form->hasError('name'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="text" name="name" id="name" value="<?php $form->echoValue('name') ?>" required/>

	<label for="email" class="required">E-Mail</label>
	<input<?php e($form->hasError('_from'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="email" name="_from" id="email" value="<?php $form->echoValue('_from') ?>" required/>

	<label for="message">Message</label>
	<textarea name="message" id="message"><?php $form->echoValue('message') ?></textarea>

	<label class="uniform__potty" for="website">Please leave this field blank</label>
	<input type="text" name="website" id="website" class="uniform__potty" />

	<a name="form"></a>
<?php if ($form->hasMessage()): ?>
	<div class="message <?php e($form->successful(), 'success' , 'error')?>">
		<?php $form->echoMessage() ?>
	</div>
<?php endif; ?>

	<button type="submit" name="_submit" value="<?php echo $form->token() ?>"<?php e($form->successful(), ' disabled')?>>Submit</button>

</form>
```

In case "Martin" with email "martin@example.com" submitted the message "hello", the email would look like this:

From: `info@my-domain.tld`

ReplyTo: `Martin<martin@example.com>`

Subject: `Message from the web form`

Body:
```txt
Name: Martin

Message: hello
```

### extended

This form extends the basic example by radio buttons and `select` fields as well as a custom subject. It validates a non-required field, too. For the email body the `uniform-email-table` snippet provided by this repo is used. For the HTML snippet to work, a `html-mail` email service is used that is *not* provided by this repo.

When the form is sent, a copy of the email will be sent to `me-too@example.com`, as well as to the sender of the form if they checked the `_receive_copy` checkbox (but only once since we set the `receive-copy` property to `false` for the second email action).

Controller:

```php
<?php

return function($site, $pages, $page) {
	$form = uniform('registration-form', [
		'required' => [
			'name'   => '',
			'_from'  => 'email'
		],
		'validate' => [
			'attendees'	=> 'num'
		],
		'actions' => [
			[
				'_action' => 'email',
				'to'      => 'me@example.com',
				'sender'  => 'info@my-domain.tld',
				'subject' => 'Exhibition - New registration',
				'snippet' => 'uniform-email-table'
			],
			[
				'_action'      => 'email',
				'to'           => 'me-too@example.com',
				'sender'       => 'info@my-domain.tld',
				'subject'      => 'Exhibition - New registration',
				'snippet'      => 'uniform-email-table',
				'receive-copy' => false
			]
		]
	]);

	return compact('form');
};
```

Template:

```php
<form action="<?php echo $page->url()?>#form" method="post">

	<label for="name" class="required">Name</label>
	<input<?php e($form->hasError('name'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="text" name="name" id="name" value="<?php $form->echoValue('name') ?>" required/>

	<label for="email" class="required">E-Mail</label>
	<input<?php e($form->hasError('_from'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="email" name="_from" id="email" value="<?php $form->echoValue('_from') ?>" required/>

	<label for="expertise">Area of expertise</label>
	<input type="text" name="expertise" id="expertise" value="<?php $form->echoValue('expertise') ?>"/>

	<label for="attendees">Number of attendees</label>
	<input<?php e($form->hasError('attendees'), ' class="erroneous"')?> type="number" name="attendees" id="attendees" value="<?php $form->echoValue('attendees') ?>"/>

	<label for="booth">Booth size</label>
	<select name="booth" id="booth">
		<?php $value = $form->value('booth') ?>
		<option value="6 sqm"<?php e($value=='6 sqm', ' selected')?>>6 m²</option>
		<option value="12 sqm"<?php e($value=='12 sqm', ' selected')?>>12 m²</option>
		<option value="18 sqm"<?php e($value=='18 sqm', ' selected')?>>18 m²</option>
		<option value="special"<?php e($value=='special', ' selected')?>>special size >18 m²</option>
	</select>

	<div class="radio-group">
		<div class="radio-group__label">Do you want to receive the newsletter?</div>
		<?php $value = $form->value('newsletter') ?>
		<label for="newsletter-yes">
			<input type="radio" name="newsletter" id="newsletter-yes" value="yes"<?php e($value=='yes'||$value=='', ' checked')?>/> Yes
		</label>
		<label for="newsletter-no">
			<input type="radio" name="newsletter" id="newsletter-no" value="no"<?php e($value=='no', ' checked')?>/> No
		</label>
	</div>

	<label for="receive-copy">
		<input type="checkbox" name="_receive_copy" id="receive-copy" <?php e($form->value('_receive_copy'), ' checked')?>/> Receive a copy of the sent data
	</label>

	<label for="message">Message</label>
	<textarea name="message" id="message"><?php $form->echoValue('message') ?></textarea>

	<label class="uniform__potty" for="website">Please leave this field blank</label>
	<input type="text" name="website" id="website" class="uniform__potty" />

	<a name="form"></a>
<?php if ($form->hasMessage()): ?>
	<div class="message <?php e($form->successful(), 'success' , 'error')?>">
		<?php $form->echoMessage() ?>
	</div>
<?php endif; ?>

	<button type="submit" name="_submit" value="<?php echo $form->token() ?>"<?php e($form->successful(), ' disabled')?>>Submit</button>

</form>
```

In case "Martin" with email "martin@example.com" has "JavaScript" as area of expertise, brings 3 attendees, wants a 12 m² booth, doesn't want to receive the newsletter and submitted the message "hello", the email would look like this:

From: `info@my-domain.tld`

ReplyTo: `Martin<martin@example.com>`

Subject: `Exhibition - New registration`

Body:
```html
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Field</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Name</td>
			<td>Martin</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Expertise</td>
			<td>JavaScript</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Attendees</td>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Booth</td>
			<td>12 sqm</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Newsletter</td>
			<td>no</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Message</td>
			<td>hello</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```
